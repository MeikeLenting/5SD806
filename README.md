Assignment 3

This assignment was to implement A* for the sheep and the wolf, and to showcase the paths in the editor. For the PwD part the assignment was to add a herder, who is attacked when they get too close to the wolf. The wolf is supposed to keep the distance from the herder usually. 

When the program is started up a window will be displayed. In this F1 can be pressed to show the edit mode, in which more information about entities can be obtained. To see more information on a specific tile, hover over it with the cursor. To enable/disable a tile, click the left mouse button. To switch between which entities display paths, click the tab button. To exit edit mode, press F1 again. In Play mode, you can control the herder by left clicking on a Tile. To close the program, press Escape.
